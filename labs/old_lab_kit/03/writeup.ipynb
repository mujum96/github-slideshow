        "## Purpose\n",
        "\n",
        "The purpose of this lab is to build and measure two antennas, one for transmit and one for receive, for a specified BF / RF frequency (Baseband Frequency / Radio Frequency).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Outline\n",
        "- Using the soldered wire/SMA antenna (soldered by TAs), move to the FieldFox and measure reflection coefficient. Observe that the resonant frequency is significantly higher than baseband but not at a desirable frequency (i.e., 2.4 GHz ISM band).\n",
        "- Progressively trim the antenna wires until the dipole antenna resonates at 2.4 GHz.\n",
        "- Designate one antenna as the transmit antenna, and connect it to a VCO.\n",
        "- Designate the other antenna as the receive antenna, and connect it to the scope or FieldFox.\n",
        "- Verify the polarization effect.\n",
        "- Take measurements of this \"system\" and connect to equations presented in lecture on the frequency response of the antennas as well as path loss.\n",
        "- Save antennas in your lab kit box for upcoming labs.\n",
        "\n",
        "## \"Build it\"\n",
        "\n",
        "### Antenna fabrication\n",
        "- Build two matched dipole antennas:\n",
        "- Solder a 50mm wire to the center pin of an SMA connector and another 50mm wire to one of the ground pins/shield (Done by TA).\n",
        "- Using S11 measurement in FieldFox Network Analyzer mode begin to trim the wires until the antenna becomes resonant (|S11|<-10dB) at 2.4 GHz.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Validate link budgets\n",
        "\n",
        "Baseband attempt:\n",
        "- Connect the ADALM baseband directly to the transmit antenna and connect the receive antenna to the FieldFox. *Attempt* to measure the received power with the FieldFox at a close range such as 1 centimeter.\n",
        "- Compute the effective gain of your antenna at baseband (it should be quite low)\n",
        "\n",
        "RF attempt:\n",
        "- Do the same thing at 2.4 GHz and validate your prelab link budget.\n",
        "- Calibrate the VCO in your lab kit (Done by TA).\n",
        "- Use your VCO to excite the antenna\n",
        "\n",
        "### Friis experiments\n",
        "Now, using the 2.4 GHz with your antennas, experiment with the various variables in the Friis equation\n",
        "- Range: receive power decrease 6dB per doubling (octave) of the range and 20dB per decade of the range.\n",
        "- Polarization: rotate your RX antenna wrt TX antenna at co-pol, cross-pol (90 degrees) and at 45 degrees and confirm the polarization efficiency of cos(theta) --- thus the 45 degree should be 70.7%."
