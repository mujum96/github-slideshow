        "\n",
        "In this lab, we are going to observe the operation and measure the performance of a baseband wireline communication system. A typical communication system, whether it's wired or wireless, can be described in terms of the layers involved in designing the system. For example, the communication system that we are going see in today's lab allows us to do Webcam livestreaming as one of its applications (\"Application layer\"). But in the physical layer, the data is actually transmitted bit by bit and packet by packet using the On-Off Keying (OOK) Modulation. On-Off Keying, as the simplest form of amplitude-shift keying (ASK) modulation, transmits digital data using the presence and absence of the carrier wave. Specifically, the presence of a carrier for a certain duration represents a binary \"1\", whereas the absence of the carrier for the same duration represents a binary \"0\". The communication system examined in today's lab utilizes a sinusoidal carrier wave with 0 Hz frequency (thus a baseband system), and for such a system there are some key parameters that need to be considered during the designing process, such as the oversampling factor M, the Digital-Analog Converter (DAC) sampling rate fs and the packet size N.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Oversampling factor M: We have mentioned above that On-off Keying modulation conveys information (bit \"0\" and bit \"1\") using the presence and absence of the carrier wave for a certain duration. But a question we could ask is for how long we should keep the carrier on (or off) when transmitting a bit \"1\" (or \"0\")? The oversampling factor answers this question by specifying the number of samples used to represent each individual bit. For example, M=3 means that each bit \"1\" is represneted by 3 samples of the carrier wave. Choosing a small value of M typically means we are able to send data at a faster rate because each bit is represented by fewer samples, however a small oversampling factor also makes a system more vulnerable to noise and interference.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. DAC Output sampling rate fs: The digital to analog converter is a crucial component of the communication system because it converts the digital signal we generated (e.g: samples of a carrier wave) into the analog signal that can be transmitted through wired or wireless link. The most important parameter of a DAC is its output sampling rate, indicating the number of samples converted per second.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. OOK packet length N: While we transmit the digital data in the physical layer using bits, each bit is not transmitted separately. In fact, they are grouped together in terms of packets before being processed and sent by the OOK communication system. Although various kinds of packet structures are adopted in today's modern communication networks for different purposes, two basic components that must be present in a packet are its header and payload. The header signals the receiver the arrival of data and also provides other information such as the destination address, the sender's address, the length of the packet for packets of variable size as well as the protocals used. The payload section contains the actual data that is to be received by the receiver. When grouping bits into packets, one key parameter is the packet length, which simply means the number of bits (or bytes) contained in one packet. The packet length of a communication system will have influence on both it's throughput as well as it's packet error ratio (PER).\n",
        "\n",
        "Our objective in this lab is to measure the performance (throughput) of our OOK baseband communication system and try maximizing its throughput by adjusting the key parameters mentioned above.\n",

        "<img src=\"https://ndwireless.github.io/radioware/lab2_01.png\">\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Software programs\n",
        "\n",
        "In this lab we will be using two Python programs OOK_transmitter_rf.py and OOK_receiver_rf.py that enable us to establish and evaluate a wireline communication system. Both programs are available in the zipped lab 2 folder you downloaded.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Running the entire system\n",
        "There are two options available for us to run the OOK transmitter and receiver programs: the command line option and the graphical user interface (GUI) option.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Running programs through the command line:\n",
        "1. Connect the computers and the ADALMs together following the block diagram shown above.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. On the computer of the transmitter side, open a cmd (Command Prompt) window in the directory that contains the python program OOK_transmitter_rf.py. \n",
        "\n",
        "3. On the computer of the receiver side, open a cmd (Command Prompt) window in the directory that contains the python program OOK_receiver_rf.py. \n",
        "\n",
        "4. On the command prompt of the transmitter side, type \"python OOK_transmitter_rf.py -h\". This will lead you to the usage page where all the available options are displayed along with their functions.\n",
        "<img src=\"https://ndwireless.github.io/radioware/lab2_02.PNG\">\n",
        "\n",
        "5. As we can see, four modes of operation are available for our communication system (\"Streaming mode\", \"Iperf mode\", \"Overhead_test mode\" and \"Error test mode\") along with other key parameters and options. To begin with, let's test our OOK transmitter and receiver under the iPerf mode. Iperf is a widely used network performance measurement tool that can be used to measure the throughput of a communication system.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. First, on the receiver PC, type the following command in the cmd window: \"python OOK_receiver_rf.py -m 2 -s\". This initiates our receiver in Iperf mode and the \"-s\" optional arugment should be included when we are running the transmitter and receiper in the same device (otherwise \"-s\" option is not needed). As you will see, there is another window popping up with descriptions such as \"Server listening on UDP port 5005\" and \"Receiving 1880 byte datagrams\". This indicates that an Iperf server has been established to receive the UDP datagrams sent from the client. We will later explain how Iperf measures the network performance using these UDP datagrams.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Now, on the transmitter PC, type the following command in the cmd window:\"python OOK_transmitter_rf.py -m 2 -s\" which initiates the iPerf client and starts an Iperf test.\n",
        "8. As the transmitter program starts running, you will begin to notice all four opened cmd windows are starting to print out some throughput information. At the end of the Iperf test, you should see output screen on the receiver and transmitter side looking like the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "Receiver side output screen:\n",
        "<img src=\"https://ndwireless.github.io/radioware/lab2_03.PNG\">\n",
        "\n",
        "Transmitter side output screen:\n",
        "<img src=\"https://ndwireless.github.io/radioware/lab2_04.PNG\">\n",
        "\n",
        "Note: Again, if you are running both programs in the same machine, make sure you connect the transmitter ADALM with the computer before connecting the receiver ADALM and also include \"-s\" in your command line arguments. This will tell the programs that you are operating the Tx and Rx in the same machine and the first plugged-in device is the transmitter.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Running programs through the GUI\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Connect the computers and the ADALMs together following the block diagram shown earlier.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Double click the OOK_transmitter_rf.py and OOK_receiver_rf.py programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. In the pop-up windows, you should see all the available system parameters, options and their default values. For both programs, you want to change the operation mode to Mode 2 (Iperf test mode) because Mode 1 (Streaming mode) is set as default operation mode.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Then, make sure the checkbox \"Run programs in the same machine\" is checked if both of your TX and Rx are connected to the same computer.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Leave all other parameters and options at their default values and make sure \"Visualize the received signal\" checkbox is not checked. Click \"Submit\" on the receiver program first and wait until after the iPerf server is initialized (a new window will pop up), click \"Submit\" on the transmitter program to start our iperf client. Wait until the end of the test to observe the performance measurement results.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Understanding the performance metrics\n",
        "\n",
        "Now we are going to interpret the performance test results and try maximizing the throughput of our OOK communication system.\n",
        "In the iperf test results presented at the receiver side, you will notice several parameters such as \"Transfer\", \"Bandwidth\", \"Jitter\" and \"Lost/Total Datagrams\". The transfer column indicates the amount of data transferred from the Iperf client to the Iperf server. Iperf calculates the throughput of a communication system by sending a certain amount of data from the transmitter (iperf client) to the receiver (iperf server) and measuring the times it takes for the receiver to receive the data sent. When there is no datagram loss, the measured average throughput (shown in receiver Iperf's \"Bandwidth\" column) is given by the following formula:\n",
        "\n",
        "Average_throughput = Total amount of data sent during the test / Test duration\n",
        "\n",
        "On the receiver side's iperf report, we could see the measured average throughput is 96.8kbit/s and all 200 datagram sent were successfully received by our iperf server. The reason we are getting 96.8 kbits/s is because our transmitter (Iperf client) is set to send UDP datagrams at a default rate of 100 kbits/s. You could change iperf client's datagram sending speed by using the -b optional argument (see -h usage page) or by entering the new bandwidth in the transmitter GUI. As we gradually increase our sender's (iperf client's) bandwidth, you may notice the datagram loss displalyed at the iperf output page (on the server/receiver side) no longer stays at zero percent. And this tells us that we have reached the maximum throughput of the OOK system with the current parameter settings. Thus, to make our defintion of throughput more precise and specific, it is the maximum bandwidth you could observe from Iperf receiver's (server's) test report with 0 percent datagram loss.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note: You may need to increase the sender's bandwidth (-b) to as high as 750k in order to observe the datagram loss on the receiver side. (see figure below)\n",
        "\n",
        "<img src=\"https://ndwireless.github.io/radioware/lab2_05.PNG\">\n",
        "\n",
        "Previously, we have mentioned several key parameters that are crucial to the performance of a OOK-based communication system. Your task in this part of the lab is to adjust those parameters to different values in order to maximize the throughput of the OOK system. By selecting different values of oversampling factor M, sampling rate fs, packet length N and following the steps described below, try getting your throughput (measured by the bandwidth shown on iperf server's output page) as high as possible (e.g: 850kb/s). \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Procedures to follow when measuring the maximum throughput of your system:\n",
        "1. Decide on what values of parameters (M, fs, R) you would like to use for the system, note that your OOK packet payload size N=R*1504 bits (the larger the R, the longer the packet payload).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Begin the iperf test by first typing the following command (or entering parameter values on the GUI) to start the receiver program: \"python OOK_receiver_rf.py -m 2 -r your_R_value -o your_oversampling_factor -f your_sampling_rate -s\".\n",
        "Then, on the transmitter program, type a similar command: \"python OOK_transmitter_rf.py -m 2 -r your_R_value -o your_oversampling_factor -f your_sampling_rate -b your_chosen_bitrate -s\".\n",
        "Remember the parameters (M,fs,R) chosen for both programs need to be consistent (e.g., if M is set to 3 on the Tx side, it should be set to 3 on the Rx side as well).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Start from a relatively low bit rate, such as 300k, and observe the throughput (under the \"Bandwidth\" column) measured by the iperf server. If you obtain zero datagram loss, increase your bit rate and repeat iperf test with the new bit rate. Once you have started to get non-zero datagram loss, record the highest iperf server bandwidth you can get with zero datagram loss as your maximum throughput corresponding to current parameter settings.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Repeat step 1-3 with a different set of parameter values and measure the maximum throughput. Try get your maximum throughput (measured iperf server bandwidth) as close to (or beyond) 850 kb/s as possible.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example result:\n",
        "<img src=\"https://ndwireless.github.io/radioware/lab2_06.PNG\">\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "What is the maximum (zero datagram loss) throughput you can reach? What are the corrsponding parameter values for the sampling rate, oversampling factor and packet size (give the value of R you selected)?\n",
        "\n",
        "Note 1: Many parameters can only have certain allowed values (please refer to the helper page). In addition, the parameter R cannot exceeed 340 with oversampling factor M=6 or 690 with oversampling factor M=3, and oversampling factor M cannot be lower than 3.<br>\n",
        "Note 2: As mentioned above, when reading the througput(bandwidth) you should refer to the server output page (receiver) since it represents the actual speed of the system. (The transmitter side bandwidth is always close to what you specified through \"-b\" argument) <br>\n",
        "Note 3: To stop a program and enter new parameters in command line, press \"Ctrl+Break\". <br>\n",
        "Note 4: By choosing parameters in a \"smart\" (carefully arranged) way you should be able to significantly reduce the time it requires to find the optimal parameter settings. For example, if you have decided on the oversampling factor and oversampling rate and want to find an optimal value for R, you could try R=100, 200, 300, 400... Then, if the maximum throughput at R=300 is greater than at R=200 OR 400, try R= 220, 260, 300, 340, 380, etc.<br>\n",
        "Note5: Default parameter values are M=6, R=100, fs=75000000.\n",
        "\n",
        "###Inspecting UDP packet structure using Wireshark\n",
        "After maximizing the throughput of our OOK system over a couple of paramters, in this part we are going to observe the UDP datagrams transmitted during the Iperf test using another widely used tool called Wireshark.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Open the Wireshark\n",
        "\n",
        "2. In the \"Welcome to Wireshark\" page, under the \"Capture\" section, double-click \"Npcap Loopback Adapter\". You should see a new page popping up which shows the packets captured.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Now start the iperf receiver program and then the iperf transmitter program, as we did in previous sections (with the parameter values you optimized).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Once the test is complete, click the red square button on the top-left corner to stop capturing.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Below shows the sample Wireshark output obtained by performing an Iperf test using the default parameters.\n",
        "<img src=\"https://ndwireless.github.io/radioware/lab2_07.PNG\">\n",
        "\n",
        "6. There are three major sections in the Wireshark packet capturing output page. The top section of the output page displays all the frames/datagrams captured while we are conducting the iperf test. To view the detailed information of any datagram, first click to select a UDP datagram from the top section, then in the middle section you will be able to see all of components of a datagram, such as the IP header, UDP header and data(payload). Clicking each component in the middle section and you may notice that the size of each component (in bytes) is shown at the bottom of the Wireshark window. \n",
        "\n",
        "7. Although the output information of our OOK transmitter and receiver programs, when running under the default parameter settings, show that the size of each UDP datagram sent and received is 1880 bytes, you may notice that the actual length of each datagram displayed on the top section of Wireshark output is 1912 (bytes). This is due to the packet encapsulation method used in computer networking, and in this case we have the total UDP datagram length 1912 bytes given by 4 bytes of null/loopback protocal header (Data-link Layer in OSI model)+ 20 bytes of IP header (Network Layer in OSI model) + 8 bytes of UDP header (Transport Layer in OSI model) + 1880 bytes of payload.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. Finally, if you click the \"Data\" component in the middle section of Wireshark window, the bytes corresponding to the data/payload will be highlighted in blue in the bottom section. What did you notice about the payload transmitted during the iperf test? \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Entering the parameters to look at the video streaming\n",
        "Now, with the parameters you have optimized, type \"python OOK_transmitter_rf.py -m 1 (add your optional arguments)\" and \"python OOK_receiver_rf.py -m 1 (add your optional arguments)\" to run the transmitter and receiver programs in Webcam streaming mode (or alternatively, you can start the programs by specifying the mode and parameter values using the GUI). For example, if your optimized parameters are: M=3, R=400, f=75000000, you should enter the following commands:<br>\n",
        "python OOK_transmitter_rf.py -m 1 -s -r 400 -o 3 -f 75000000<br>\n",
        "python OOK_receiver_rf.py -m 1 -s -r 400 -o 3 -f 75000000<br>\n",
        "\n",
        "After the video streaming is established, use Wireshark to start the packet capturing, look at the displayed packet information (packet type, packet size, payload, etc.)\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, close the Wireshark and restart the transmitter and receiver programs in video streaming mode, how long is the streaming delay?\n",
        "\n",
        "While adjusting the parameters of our OOK communication system, we may notice that a higher value of R, corresponding to longer packet payload size, tend to give higher throughput due to that fact that there is less overhead (non-information bits) for a given amount of payload (bits actually containing information). However, larger packet size also leads to larger delay of the data/video stream. Now, try adjusting your value of R to see if you can reduce the delay to less than 7 seconds.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Disconnecting the wire to observe the Tx output\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, disconnect the wires between two ADALMs and try performing an iperf test, can you still get meaningful results? (In future labs of this semester we will explore how to rebuild the connections through wireless link/radio)\n",
        "\n",
        "Connect the oscilloscope with the transmitter ADALM and run OOK_transmitter_rf program in streaming mode with different parameters (packet length, oversampling factor, sampling rate), compare the traces observed from the oscilloscope for different parameter settings.\n",
        "\n",
        "Follow the steps below to observe the output of your OOK transmitter on the oscilloscope:\n",
        "1. Disconnect the OOK transmitter from the OOK receiver.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Connect a probe to channel 1 of the oscilloscope (labeled in yellow).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Connect the pin \"W1\" (analog output, channel 1) of the transmitter ADALM with the probe.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Connect the ground pin of the transmitter ADALM with the ground of the probe.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Start the transmitter program by typing in cmd:\"python OOK_transmitter_rf.py -m 1 (Add your options for parameters)\" For example, you could start with the default parameter by simply typing: <br>\n",
        "python OOK_transmitter_rf.py -m 1\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Turn on the oscilloscope and adjust the vertical scale (voltage scale) to 1.0 V/div and the horizontal scale (time scale) to 1 us/div.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Set the trigger level to about 0.5V.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. Press the \"Single\" button and wait for the trace to be captured. \n",
        "\n",
        "9. As you change the OOK parameters to different values, you may need to adjust the voltage and time scale accordingly in order to get a clean trace. \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Symbol-level and packet-level measurement\n",
        "As the final part of the lab, we would like to verify the symbol rate of our OOK signals using the oscilloscope and investigate the effect of header sequence length on the transmitter throughput.\n",
        "\n",
        "In digital communications, the symbol rate, also known as the the baud rate, is the number of symbol changes or waveform changes occurred per unit time across the transmission medium (wired or wireless). In our case of baseband OOK modulation, the symbol rate is defined as the number of bit \"1\" (carrier wave on) and bit \"0\" (carrier wave off) transmitted through the digital-to-analog converter (DAC) per unit time. Since the DAC converts fs number of samples per sec and we used M (oversampling factor) samples to represent one bit, the symbol rate is simply given by: \n",
        "\n",
        "Rs=fs/M (symbols/sec)\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, with the parameter settings M=6 and fs=75000000 samples/sec, we expect to get Rs=75000000/6=12.5M (symbols/sec). Now we are going to confirm this value by measuring the waveform using the oscilloscope:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Start your transmitter in streaming mode by typing in cmd:\"python OOK_transmitter_rf.py -m 1 -o 6 -f 75000000\". This sets the oversampling factor to M=6 and sampling rate fs to 75000000 Hz.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Keep the trigger voltage level at 0.5 V, adjust the horizontal scale to 500.0 ns/div.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Use the \"Single\" button to capture the waveform and adjust the time delay to 1.550 us in order to have more portion of the waveform shown on the screen. Your captured trace (after adjusting the time delay) should look like the following:\n",
        "<img src=\"https://ndwireless.github.io/radioware/lab2_08.png\">\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Shown above are actually the first couple of bits of an OOK packet, known as the \"header\" of the packet. Given that each packet has a 50-bit long header, can you tell what the header sequence is based on what is displayed on the scope? How did you determine it? (Hint: the header starts with a '1' so don't count the initial period of zero voltage as '0's)\n",

        "5. Now we are going to measure the symbol rate of the transmitted signals. Since in our case (OOK modulation) the symbol rate is just the number of bits transmitted per unit time. We could first measure the amount to time it takes to send one bit and then take its reciprocal to get the symbol rate. Alternatively, in order to improve the accuracy, we could also measure duration of 10 bits and then multiply its reciprocal by 10. \n",

        "6. To measure the duration of any portions of the signal waveform on the oscilloscope, we will be using the \"Cursors\" function. First of all, find the \"Cursors\" button under the \"Measure\" section of the oscilloscope.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. In addition, if we would like to measure the duration of the first ten bit of the packet, we need to know that the packet header is actually composed of 10 one's followed by 10 zero's followed by 20 one's and then followed by 10 zero's. Therefore, to measure the first ten bit '1's, move the X1 cursor to the beginning of the 10 one's and move the X2 cursor to the tail of the 10 one's, as shown in the figure below: \n",

        "\n",
        "8. As we could see, the oscilloscope automatically calculates the time difference between X1 and X2 points and return its reciprocal. The measured symbol rate is thus given by 1.2500 MHz * 10 (bits) = 12.5M (symbols/sec), same as what we have calculated.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Now, suppose we want an On-off modulation for a particular symbol rate 2.5M samples/sec. What should the sampling rate and oversampling factor be? Is your answer unique? Verify your calculations by comparing them with the oscilloscope measurement.\n",
        "\n",
        "The final exercise today is to observe the effect of packet header length on the throughput of the OOK Tx & Rx system. Since the total packet length (header+payload) used for streaming or iperf testing is much greater than the 50-bit header, we are going to use a specially designed third mode (\"overhead test\" mode) in which we will generate packets consisting of a 50-bit header and comparable size of payload (e.g., 40 bit length).\n",
        "\n",
        "Start the transmitter and receiver programs in the command line with default options by typing: \"Python OOK_transmitter_rf.py -m 3 -s\" and \"Python OOK_receiver_rf.py -m 3 -s\", observing\n",
        "\n",
        " the throughput reported by the Tx and Rx programs. \n",
        "\n",
        "The throughput you observed should be pretty low because the data payload size is set to 40 bits only. Increase the size of the OOK packet payload using the -p command line arguement (or entering the payload length via the GUI), observe the new reported throughput and try explaining what happened. (e.g., what is the new throughput if the payload size is increased to 100 bits? 1000 bits? 10000 bits? Are the results expected? )\n",
        "\n",
        "Note: Make sure you update the payload length on both the transmitter and receiver sides.\n",
